microdadosBrasil
================

`microdadosBrasil` is originally a toolset to read public brazilian microdata such as PNAD and Censo Escolar maintained by [Lucas Mation](https://github.com/lucasmation/microdadosBrasil). In this fork, I have modified some functions to support my specific needs, e.g., download the Censo Demogr√°fico only for Pernambuco, read Censo Escolar with ``ff`` to support very large datasets, among others.
